            <p style="color:white"> I spent the early years of my life living up in the mountains with my grandfather. He
                built this nice little log cabin up there and taught me how to hunt snipes.. One day I really hope to
                catch one.. I haven't been able to do it yet but I know if I ever get the chance to go back to them
                mountains I will!</p>
